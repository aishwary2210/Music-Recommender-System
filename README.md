# Music-Recommender-System ML Models

Predicting song popularity based on song features and listening behavior
is of growing importance for streaming services and for music
producers. In this study, we will apply and compare many supervised
learning methods, including logistic regression, ridge and lasso
regression, KNN, SVM, and Na√Øve Bayes to predict music popularity.
High dimensional visualization techniques will be used to visualize the
data. A thorough literature review will be conducted at the beginning of
the study to identify and document the state-of-the-art in music
recommendation. One of the datasets we will explore is made available
by Spotifylabs contains 19,000 songs and 15 features that past research
has used in similar studies. The features that we will explore include
audio mode, time signature, acousticness, danceability, energy,
instrumentalness, loudness, speechiness, audio valence, tempo, liveness,
and song popularity.

Every year, number of individual of group of artists launch there music in the form of new song, album or remixed version on various platforms such as Spotify. Success of the song depends on various attributes, understanding & find the mechanism which helps to determine the factors which are responsible for the popularity of song is a good information to have both for artist and the record labels.
Currently, being able to predict that something might be popular beforehand is an important research subject for every industry. It also has recently became a very important subject for the growing and competitive music industry as well. Since wide use of digital music platforms (Spotify, Billboard, Lastfm), data can be easily reached and the listening behaviors of the listeners can be easily observed. This provides convenience in forecasting techniques and it is also frequently used in recommendation systems.
Every song has number of attributes, by studying & understanding this attributes with the help of previously obtained data helps us to predict the behavior of that particular data and able to make predictions on that.
By using data science techniques & algorithms we will build recommender system which will help us to find the popularity of the music and answer some of the questions from the dataset.
